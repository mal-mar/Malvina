# Malvina
"Malvina" is a script written as part of a team student project at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Warsaw. 
The aim of this project was to create a Python script which, by means of Fourier transformations of TEM images, would enable finding the images in the reverse space. The main application of such a program would be to determine the homogeneity of the structure of the tested sample - monolayer of metallic nanoparticles. Such information would serve to study the self-organization of nanoparticles and the periodicity of their mutual arrangement. 
Metallic nanoparticles are used for the synthesis of electrically conductive substrates and electromagnetic radiation, which are used in electrooptics. The regularity in the mutual arrangement of nanoparticles plays an important role in determining the properties of a given material, which is why it is so important to determine the uniformity of their structure.
